"""
This program will tell us if working for $100 a day versus $1
a day that doubles each time with every day that we worked 
will net us more money. We will use 2 functions to find this out
then compare them and tell us which one is worth more.

function1 will be 100 * 10 days
function2 will loop 10 times, doulbing each time

if the amount is equal it will say "Both options are the same"
if Option 1 pays more it will say "Option 1 pays more"
if Option 2 pays more it will say "Option 2 pays more"
